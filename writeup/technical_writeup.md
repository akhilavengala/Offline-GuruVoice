Offline GuruVoice – Technical Writeup
Overview
Offline GuruVoice is an AI-powered education app designed to help students — especially in rural and low-connectivity regions — get doubt solutions offline in their favorite voice (like a teacher, parent, or hero).

It solves a key problem: many learners struggle to understand concepts when explained in standard or robotic tones. By delivering answers in emotionally familiar voices, GuruVoice makes learning more engaging and effective — even without internet access.

Technical Architecture

Core Technologies:
- AI Model: Planned - Gemma 3n (4B) running via Ollama or Android
- Voice Output: XTTS-lite (open-source voice cloning)
- OCR (Image-to-Text): Tesseract OCR or Google ML Kit
- Voice Input: Android Speech-to-Text
- Voice Playback: Android Text-to-Speech with cloned voices
- App UI: Built with Flutter (prototype)
- Languages: English, Telugu, and Hindi

Key Features
- Snap a Question: Use OCR to extract text from handwritten or printed doubts.
- Ask by Voice: Students can speak their doubt instead of typing.
- Voice Output: Answers are spoken in a familiar, selected voice.
- Offline Flashcards: Create practice questions based on past doubts.
- Offline Mode: All features work without an internet connection.
- Multilingual: English, Telugu, and Hindi supported.

Challenges Solved
- No Internet Access: Students in rural areas often lack stable connectivity. This app works fully offline.
- Lack of Personalization: Robotic AI voices reduce interest. Our app uses voices students trust or admire.
- Doubt Isolation: With no tutor or teacher nearby, students can still learn via AI mentoring.

How Gemma 3n Is Used
- Runs On-Device: Gemma 3n processes input directly on the phone for speed, privacy, and offline access.
- Multimodal Capability: Understands voice, image, and text for full flexibility.
- Privacy-First: No personal data leaves the device.

Code Repository (To Be Uploaded)
The GitHub repository will contain:
- Pseudocode
- UI flow diagrams
- OCR + Voice module structure
- App architecture and mock inference demo

Future Work
- Add voice packs for famous teachers, parents, or celebrities.
- Enable voice cloning using just a 10-second voice sample.
- Add daily learning planner and student dashboard.
- Support more Indian languages (Marathi, Kannada, Tamil).
- Enable student-to-student help (peer mentoring model).

Goal
Empower every student to learn clearly, emotionally, and independently — even in remote areas without internet — using the power of AI and personalization.

Built for the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge 2025.
